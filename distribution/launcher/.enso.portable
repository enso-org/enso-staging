This file is present in the root of the portable Enso distribution to allow the
universal launcher to detect if it should run in portable or locally installed
mode.

It is advised not to remove this file, unless deleting the whole directory.

If you want to locally install the launcher, you should not remove this file,
but simply run `./bin/enso install distribution`.
