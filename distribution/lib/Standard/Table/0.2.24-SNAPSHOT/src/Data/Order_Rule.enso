type Order_Rule

    ## UNSTABLE

       A rule used for sorting table-like structures.

       Arguments:
       - column: a value representing the data dimension by which this rule is
         sorting. This type does not specify the underlying representation of a
         column, assuming that the sorting engine defines its own column
         representation.
       - comparator: a function taking two elements of the data being sorted on
         and returning an `Ordering`. The function may be `Nothing`, in which
         case a natural ordering will be used.  Note that certain table backends
         (such us database connectors) may not support this field being set to a
         non-`Nothing` value.
       - order: specifies whether the table should be sorted in an ascending or
         descending order. The default value of `Nothing` delegates the decision
         to the sorting function. Can be set to `Sort_Order.Ascending` or
         `Sort_Order.Descending` from the `Base` library, to specify the
         ordering.
       - missing_last: whether the missing values should be placed at the
         beginning or end of the sorted table. Note that this argument is
         independent from `order`, i.e. missing values will always be sorted
         according to this rule, ignoring the ascending / descending setting.
         The default value of `Nothing` delegates the decision to the sorting
         function.
