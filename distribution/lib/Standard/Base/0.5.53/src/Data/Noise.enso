## Generate noise based on the input number.

   Arguments:
   - interval: An interval in which the noise should be generated.
   - gen: The generator to use for generating noise.

   The output of the noise generator will depend on the input and the range over
   which the noise is being generated.

   By default, this uses a seeded deterministic generator that will always
   return the same input for the same output. In addition, it will, by default,
   generate values in the exclusive range 0 to 1.

   > Example
     Deterministically perturb the input number 1.
         1.noise
Number.noise : Interval -> Generator -> Any
Number.noise (interval = Interval.exclusive 0 1) gen=Deterministic_Random =
    gen.step this interval
