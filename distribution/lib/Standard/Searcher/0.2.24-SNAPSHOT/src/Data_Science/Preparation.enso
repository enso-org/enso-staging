## As nice as it would be to have your data all ready for analysis, this is
   rarely the case. The process of getting it ready to provide insights is known
   as data preparation.

   This section of the library contains a curated selection of tools that help
   you to get the best out of your data. From dealing with missing values to
   getting rid of erroneous rows and columns, the tools here are specialised for
   getting the most out of your data.

   > Example

   > Example

   > Example
