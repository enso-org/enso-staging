## It is not uncommon for systems to pass configuration data and information in
   their environment variables. Enso provides you with the tools to read that
   environment, and better integrate into your workflow.

   > Example
     Look up the value of the `PATH` environment variable.

         import Standard.Base.System.Environment

         example_get = Environment.get "PATH"
