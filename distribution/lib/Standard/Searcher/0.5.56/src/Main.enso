## A library that defines the documentation for the hand-curated searcher
   categories.

   Note that there is _no functional code_ in these modules, and they should
   never be imported directly. They are used only to provide a consistent and
   simple mechanism for placing documentation for these categories within the
   suggestions database.

import Standard.Base.Error.Extensions as Error

## ALIAS Text Input

   Creating text in Enso is as simple as adding a node that contains the text
   that you would like to create.

   > Example
     Creating a node containing the text "Hello, Enso!".

         "Hello, Enso!"
text_input = Error.unimplemented "This function should not be called."

## ALIAS Number Input

   Creating a number in Enso is as simple as adding a node that contains the
   number that you would like to create.

   Enso supports both integer and decimal literals.

   > Example
     Creating a node containing the integer 0.

         0

   > Example
     Creating a node containing the decimal 0.0.

         0.0
number_input = Error.unimplemented "This function should not be called."

## ALIAS Table Input

   Creating a table in Enso is usually done directly from data. Nevertheless, it
   can be useful to create tables manually.

   > Example
     Creating a node containing a table with two columns, one titled "name", and
     the other titled "stars".

         import Standard.Table

         example_table_input =
             column_1 = ["name", "Enso"]
             column_2 = ["stars", 5000]
             table = Table.new [column_1, column_2]
table_input = Error.unimplemented "This function should not be called."
