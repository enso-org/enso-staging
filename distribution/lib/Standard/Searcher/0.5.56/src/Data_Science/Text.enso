## Textual data is one of the most common formats found during data analysis.
   This makes it all the more important that you have robust tools to manipulate
   the text as you need.

   Enso's text representation is highly efficient and comes with a robust suite
   of tools for processing the text in any way you can think of.

   > Example
     Split the text on whitespace into a vector of items.

         "ham eggs cheese tomatoes".split Split_Kind.Whitespace

   > Example
     Getting the words in the sentence "I have not one, but two cats."

        "I have not one, but two cats.".words

   > Example
     See if the text "Hello" contains the text "ell".

         "Hello".contains "ell"

   > Example
     Replace letters in the text "aaa".

         'aaa'.replace 'aa' 'b' == 'ba'
