## PRIVATE

   The internal representation of an SQL expression which can be a column
   reference, an interpolated constant or an operation that combines other
   expressions.
type Expression
    ## PRIVATE

       The internal representation of an SQL expression that gets a value from a
       column.

       Arguments:
       - origin: the name of the entity (table or sub-query) that this column
         originates from, it corresponds to the `alias` field in `from_spec`.
       - name: the name of the column directly in the table or its alias in a
         sub-query.

       The internal representation of an SQL expression which is a constant to
       be interpolated when building the query.

       - sql_type: The SQL type that this object is going to be serialized to.
         It is usually inferred from the expression's context.
       - value: the value to be interpolated; it should be a simple Number, Text
         or other types that are serializable for JDBC.
    # type Constant (sql_type : Sql.Sql_Type) (value : Any)
    type Constant sql_type value

    ## PRIVATE

       and sub-expressions.

       Arguments:
       - kind: the name of the operation, these can be both functions or infix
         operators, the actual implementation is determined by a specific
         dialect.

    ## PRIVATE

         for which these expressions evaluate to true are included in the
         result.
       - orders: a list of ordering expressions, for each entry an ORDER BY
         clause is added.
       - groups: a list of grouping expressions, for each entry a GROUP BY is
         added, the resulting query can then directly include only the
         grouped-by columns or aggregate expressions.
       - meta_index: a list of internal columns to use for joining or grouping.
       - limit: an optional maximum number of elements that the equery should
         return.
