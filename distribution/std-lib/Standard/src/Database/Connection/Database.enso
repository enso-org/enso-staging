# TODO [RW] finalize Postgres support
## UNSTABLE

   Currently only SQLite databases are supported.

   The exact URL depends on the database engine.
   For SQLite it has format `sqlite:/path/to/database/file`.

   Arguments:
   - url: the URL to connect to.
   - user: (optional) an username for authentication.
   - password: (optional) a password for authentication.
connect : Text -> Nothing | Text -> Nothing | Text -> Connection ! Sql_Error
connect url user=Nothing password=Nothing =
    full_url = if url.starts_with "jdbc:" then url else "jdbc:"+url
    Connection.create_jdbc_connection full_url user password

## UNSTABLE

   It is an alternative to `connect` that resolves a path to the database file.

   Arguments:
   - file: the path to the database.
open_sqlite_file : File -> Connection ! Sql_Error
open_sqlite_file file =
    url = "sqlite:" + file.absolute.path
    here.connect url
