## Types representing the ordering of values.

   These are intended to be returned from the `compare_to` function, that has a
   type as follows for a type `A`: `A.compare_to : A -> Ordering`.

   The result should be returned in terms of how `this` orders in comparison to
   `that`. So, if `this` is greater than `that`, you should return `Greater.`
type Ordering
    ## An ordering where a compared value is less than another.
    Less
    ## An ordering where a compared value is equal to another.
    Equal
    ## An ordering where a compared value is greater than another.
    Greater

    ## Converts the ordering to the signed notion of ordering based on integers.
    to_sign : Integer
    to_sign = case this of
        Less -> -1
        Equal -> 0
        Greater -> 1
