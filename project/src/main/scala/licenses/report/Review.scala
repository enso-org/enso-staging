/**
  * Reads settings from the `root` to add review statuses to discovered
  * attachments and add any additional attachments coming from the settings.
  *
  * The review settings consist of the following files or directories (all are
  * optional):
  *
  * - `notice-header` - contains the header that will start the main generated
  *   NOTICE
  * - `files-add` - directory that may contain additional files that should be
  *   added to the package
  * - `reviewed-licenses` - directory that may contain files for reviewed
  *   licenses; the files should be named with the normalized license name and
  *   they should contain a path to that license's file
  * - and for each dependency, a subdirectory named as its `packageName` with
  *   following entries:
  *    - `files-add` - directory that may contain additional files that should
  *      be added to the subdirectory for this package
  *    - `files-keep` - a file containing names of files found in the package
  *      sources that should be included in the package
  *    - `files-ignore` - a file containing names of files found in the package
  *      sources that should not be included
  *    - `custom-license` - a file that indicates that the dependency should not
  *      point to the default license, but it should contain a custom one within
  *      its files
  *   - `default-and-custom-license` - a file that indicates that the dependency should point to the
  *     default license, but it also contains additional license-like files that should be kept too;
  *     it disables checking if the attached license-like files are equal to the default license or
  *     not, so it should be used very carefully; at most one of `default-and-custom-license` and
  *     `custom-license` should exist for each dependency
  *    - `copyright-keep` - copyright lines that should be included in the
  *      notice summary for the package
  *    - `copyright-keep-context` - copyright lines that should be included
  *      (alongside with their context) in the notice summary for the package
  *    - `copyright-ignore` - copyright lines that should not be included in the
  *      notice summary for the package
  *    - `copyright-add` - a single file whose contents will be added to the
  *      notice summary for the package
  *
  * @param root directory that contains files which guide the review process
  * @param dependencySummary summary of discovered dependency information
