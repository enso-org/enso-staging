# Licenses

When distributing Enso, we include code from many dependencies that are used
within it. We need to ensure that we comply with the licenses of the
dependencies that we distribute with Enso.

## Gathering Used Dependencies

As a first step, we need to gather a list of which dependencies are used in the
distributed artifacts.

### SBT

We use a `GatherLicenses` task that uses the `sbt-license-report` and other
sources to gather copyright information related to the used dependencies.

To configure the task, `GatherLicenses.distributions` should be set with
sequence of distributions. Each distribution describes one component that is
distributed separately and should include all references to all projects that
are included as part of its distribution. Currently, we have the `launcher`
distribution that consists of one `launcher` component and the `engine`
distribution which includes `runtime`, `engine-runner` and `project-manager`.

Another relevant setting is `GatherLicenses.licenseConfigurations` which defines
which `ivy` configurations are considered to search for dependencies. Currently
it is set to only consider `compile` dependencies, as dependencies for
`provided`, `test` or `benchmark` are not distributed and there are no
`assembly`-specific dependencies.

`GatherLicenses.configurationRoot` specifies where the review tool will look for
the files specifying review state and `GatherLicenses.distributionRoot`
specifies where the final notice packages should be generated.

To run the automated license gathering task, run `enso/gatherLicenses` in SBT.
This will create a report and packages which are described in the
[next section](#preparing-the-distribution).

### Rust

We do not distribute any Rust-based artifacts in this repository.

> The actionables for this section are:
>
> - When the parser is rewritten to Rust and is distributed within the
>   artifacts, this section should be revisited to describe a scheme of
>   gathering dependencies used in the Rust projects.
> - It would be good to re-use the SBT task as much as possible, possibly by
>   creating a frontend for it using `cargo-license`.

## Preparing the Distribution

When a new dependency is added, the `enso/gatherLicenses` should be re-run to
generate the updated report.

The report can be opened in review mode by launching a server located in
`tools/legal-review-helper` by running `npm start` in that directory.
Alternatively, `enso/openLegalReviewReport` can be used instead to automatically
open the report in review-mode after generating it (but it requires `npm` to be
visible on the system PATH in SBT).

The report will show what license the dependencies use and include any copyright
notices and files found within each dependency.

Each copyright notice and file should be reviewed to decide if it should be kept
or ignored. If a notice is automatically detected in a wrong way, it should be
ignored and a fixed one should be added manually. The review process is
described in detail in the [next section](#review).

Each new type of license has to be reviewed to ensure that it is compatible with
our distribution and usage scheme. Licenses are reviewed per-distribution, as
for example the binary distribution of the launcher may impose different
requirements than distribution of the engine as JARs.

If an indirect dependency is found with a problematic license, the
`analyzeDependency` command may prove helpful. Running `analyzeDependency <arg>`
will search for all dependencies containing `<arg>` in their name and list in
which projects they show up and which packages depend on them directly. This
latter functionality can be used to track down the direct dependency that
brought the indirect one.

After the review is done, the `enso/gatherLicenses` should be re-run again to
generate the updated packages that are included in the distribution. Before a PR
is merged, it should be ensure that there are no warnings in the generation. The
packages are located in separate subdirectories of the `distribution` directory
for each artifact.

The CI can check if the legal review is up-to-date by running
`sbt enso / verifyLegalReview`. This task will fail if any dependencies have
changed making parts of the review obsolete or if the review contains any
warnings.

### Review

The review can be performed manually by modifying the settings inside of the
`tools/legal-review` directory or it can be partially automated.

#### Review Process

1. Open the review in edit mode using the helper script.
   - You can type `enso / openLegalReviewReport` if you have `npm` in your PATH
     as visible from SBT.
   - Or you can just run `npm start` (and `npm install` if needed) in the
     `tools/legal-review-helper` directory.
2. For each package listed in the review for a given distribution:
   1. Review licenses
      - Make sure that the component's license is accepted - that we know that
        its license type is compatible with our distribution scheme.
      - When a license is accepted, a file should be added in the
        `reviewed-licenses` directory, with name as indicated in the report. The
        file should contain a single line that is the path (relative to
        repository root) to the default license file for that license type which
        should be included in the distribution.
        - The license may have been already accepted if it is the same license
          as earlier dependencies for the same artifact.
      - Check if any license-like files have been automatically found in the
        attached files. If an attached file contains (case-insensitive)
        'license' or 'licence' in its name, the review tool will compare it with
        the default license file.
        - To trigger this comparison, the license must have been already
          reviewed when the report was being generated, so you may consider
          re-running the report after reviewing the license types to get this
          information.
        - If an attached file is exactly the same as the license file, it can be
          safely ignored.
        - If an attached file differs from the default license file, it should
          be carefully checked.
          - Most of the time, that file should be marked as kept and the default
            license ignored.
          - To ignore the default license, create a file `custom-license` inside
            the directory belonging to the relevant package containing a single
            line indicating the filename of the custom license that is included
            in attached files.
        - Sometimes the dependency does contain files called `LICENSE` or
          similar which are additional licenses or which just contain an URL of
          an actual license. In that case we may want to keep these files but
          still point to the default license file. To indicate this intention,
          create an empty file called `default-and-custom-license`.
   2. Review which files to include
      - You can click on a filename to display its contents.
      - We want to include any NOTICE files that contain copyright notices or
        credits.
      - False-positives (unrelated files) or duplicates may be ignored.
   3. Review copyright notices
      - You may click on a copyright line to display context (surrounding text)
        and in which files it was found.
      - We want to include most of the notices, as it is better to include
        duplicates rather than skip something important.
      - But we need to ignore false-positives, for example code that contains
        the word 'copyright' in it and was falsely classified.
      - You may click 'Keep' to add the displayed copyright line to the
        copyright notice or if there is exactly one context associated with the
        line, you can click 'Keep as context' to add this whole context to the
        notice.
      - If you cannot keep a notice with context because it appears in multiple
        contexts or need to slightly modify it, the standard approach is to
        'Ignore' that notice and add the correct one manually, as described
        below.
   4. Add missing information
      - You can manually add additional copyright notices by adding them to a
        file `copyright-add` inside the directory belonging to the relevant
        package.
      - You can manually add additional files by adding them into a subdirectory
        called `files-add` located in the directory belonging to the relevant
        package.
3. Add any additional information:
   - You can add additional files by adding them into a subdirectory called
     `files-add` in the root directory of distribution configuration.
   - You can create a custom notice header that will replace the default one, by
     creating a file called `notice-header`.
4. After you are done, re-run `enso/gatherLicenses` to generate the updated
   packages.
   - Ensure that there are no more warnings, and if there are any go back to fix
     the issues.

The updates performed using the web script are remembered locally, so they will
not show up after the refresh. If you ever need to open the edit mode after
closing its window, you should re-generate the report using
`enso/gatherLicenses` or just open it using `enso/openLegalReviewReport` which
will refresh it automatically.

#### Additional Manual Considerations

The Scala Library notice contains the following mention:

```
This software includes projects with other licenses -- see `doc/LICENSE.md`.
```

The licenses contained in the `doc` directory in Scala's GitHub are most likely
relevant for the Scala Compiler and not the Standard Library that is relevant
for us, but we include them for safety. When switching to a newer Scala version,
these files should be updated if there were any changes to them.

Moreover `NOTICE` files for `scala-parser-combinators` and `scala-java8-compat`
have been manually copied from their GitHub repositories. They should also be
updated as necessary.

Additionally, the Linux version of the launcher is statically linked with the
`musl` implementation of libc which also uses `zlib`, so these two components
are also added and described manually. If they are ever updated, the notices
should be revisited.

`CREDITS` for modules `com.fasterxml.jackson` mentioned in their NOTICES were
manually scraped from GitHub where possible.

Missing licenses were manually added for some dependencies - these are
dependencies whose legal-review configurations contains a license file in
`files-add`. They may need to be manually updated when updating.

#### Warnings

All warnings should be carefully reviewed and most of them will fail the CI.
However, there are some warnings that may be ignored.

Below we list the warnings that show up currently and their explanations:

- `Could not find sources for com.google.guava # listenablefuture # 9999.0-empty-to-avoid-conflict-with-guava`
  - This warning is due to the fact that this is a dummy artifact that does not
    contain any sources. We added a special note in its legal config that refers
    to the original `guava` module, so the warning can be safely discarded.
- `Found a source .../.cache/coursier/v1/https/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/scala-lang/modules/scala-collection-compat_2.13/2.1.1/scala-collection-compat_2.13-2.1.1-sources.jar that does not belong to any known dependencies, perhaps the algorithm needs updating?`
  - This is a bit unexpected - the engine does depend on
    `scala-collection-compat # 2.0.0` (used by `slick`), but here for some
    reason we find sources for version `2.1.1` (the sources for `2.0.0` are
    available too). We could not figure out this issue for now, but it is not a
    problem for the legal review, because the engine distribution does include
    all necessary information for the version it actually uses (`2.0.0`).

#### Updating Dependencies

As described above, some information has been gathered manually and as such it
should be verified if it is up-to-date when a dependency is updated.

Moreover, when a dependency version is changed, its directory name will change,
making old legal review settings obsolete. But many of these settings may be
still relevant. So to take advantage of that, the old directory should be
manually renamed to the new name and any obsolete files or copyrights should be
removed from the settings (they will be indicated by the tool as warnings).

Some Scala dependencies include the current Scala minor version in their names.
When upgrading to a newer Scala release, these names will become outdated, but a
lot of this configuration may still be relevant. The same trick should be used
as above - the old directories should be renamed accordingly to fit the new
Scala version. Given that this affects a lot of dependencies, a special tool
could be written that will automatically rename all the directories (but it can
also be achieved using shell commands).

#### Review Configuration

The review state is driven by configuration files located in
`tools/legal-review`. This directory contains separate subdirectories for each
artifact.

The subdirectory for each artifact may contain the following entries:

- `notice-header` - contains the header that will start the main generated
  NOTICE
- `files-add` - directory that may contain additional files that should be added
  to the notice package
- `reviewed-licenses` - directory that may contain files for reviewed licenses;
  the files should be named with the normalized license name and they should
  contain a path to that license's file (the path should be relative to the
  repository root)
- `.report.state` - an automatically generated file that can be used to check if
  the report is up-to-date
- and for each dependency, a subdirectory named as its `packageName` with
  following entries:
  - `files-add` - directory that may contain additional files that should be
    added to the subdirectory for this package
  - `files-keep` - a file containing names of files found in the package sources
    that should be included in the package
  - `files-ignore` - a file containing names of files found in the package
    sources that should not be included
  - `custom-license` - a file that indicates that the dependency should not
    point to the default license, but it should contain a custom one within its
    files; it should contain a single line with this custom license's filename
  - `default-and-custom-license` - a file that indicates that the dependency
    should point to the default license, but it also contains additional
    license-like files that should be kept too; it disables checking if the
    attached license-like files are equal to the default license or not, so it
    should be used very carefully; at most one of `default-and-custom-license`
    and `custom-license` should exist for each dependency
  - `copyright-keep` - copyright lines that should be included in the notice
    summary for the package
  - `copyright-keep-context` - copyright lines that should be included
    (alongside with their context) in the notice summary for the package
  - `copyright-ignore` - copyright lines that should not be included in the
    notice summary for the package
  - `copyright-add` - a single file whose contents will be added to the notice
    summary for the package

Manually adding files and copyright, modifying the notice header and marking
licenses as reviewed has to be done manually. But deciding if a file or
copyright notice should be kept or ignored can be done much quicker using the
GUI launched by `enso/openLegalReviewReport`. The GUI is a very simple one - it
assumes that the report is up to date and uses the server to modify the
configuration. The configuration changes are not refreshed automatically -
instead if the webpage is refreshed after modifications it may contain stale
information - to get up-to-date information, `enso/openLegalReviewReport` or
`enso/gatherLicenses` has to be re-run.

## Standard Library

The dependencies of standard library are built using Maven, so they have to be
handled separately. Currently there are not many of them so this is handled
manually. If that becomes a problem, they could be attached to the frontend of
the `GatherLicenses` task.

The third-party licenses for Java extensions of the standard library are
gathered in the `third-party-licenses` directory in the `Base` library. The
gathering process is partially-automatic, triggered by the `package` goal of the
associated Maven configuration file. However when another dependency is added to
the standard library, its licenses should be reviewed before merging the PR.

## Bundles

Beside the launcher and engine components, the distributed bundles also contain
a distribution of GraalVM CE. This distribution however contains its own licence
and notices within itself, so no further action should be necessary in that
regard.
