## Types

There are a number of types that are used only within the project server's
protocol messages. These are specified here.

### `ProjectMetadata`

This type represents information about a project.

#### Format

```typescript
interface ProjectMetadata {
  name: String;
  id: UUID;
  lastOpened: UTCDateTime;
}
```

### `MissingComponentAction`

This type specifies what action should be taken if a component required to
complete an operation is missing.

- `Fail` will make the operation fail if any components are missing.
- `Install` will try to install any missing components, unless they are marked
  as broken.
- `ForceInstallBroken` will try to install all missing components, even if some
  of them are marked as broken.

#### Format

```typescript
type MissingComponentAction = Fail | Install | ForceInstallBroken;
```

### `ProgressUnit`

This type specifies the unit of progress updates related to a task.

#### Format

```typescript
type ProgressUnit = Bytes | Other;
```

### `EngineVersion`

This type represents an installed or available engine version.

#### Format

```typescript
interface EngineVersion {
  /** Semver string of engine version. */
  version: String;

  /** Specifies if that version is marked as broken. */
  markedAsBroken: bool;
}
```

## Project Management Operations

The primary responsibility of the project managers is to allow users to manage
their projects.

### `project/open`

This message requests that the project manager open a specified project. This
operation also includes spawning an instance of the language server open on the
specified project.

To open a project, an engine version that is specified in project settings needs
to be installed. If `missingComponentAction` is set to `Install` or
`ForceInstallBroken`, this action will install any missing components,
otherwise, an error will be reported if a component is missing. A typical usage
scenario may consist of first trying to open the project without installing
missing components. If that fails with the `MissingComponentError`, the client
can ask the user if they want to install the missing components and re-attempt
the action.

- **Type:** Request
- **Direction:** Client -> Server
- **Connection:** Protocol
- **Visibility:** Public

#### Parameters

```typescript
interface ProjectOpenRequest {
  projectId: UUID;

  /**
   * Specifies how to handle missing components.
   *
   * If not provided, defaults to `Fail`.
   */
  missingComponentAction?: MissingComponentAction;
}
```

#### Result

```typescript
interface ProjectOpenResult {
  languageServerJsonAddress: IPWithSocket;
  languageServerBinaryAddress: IPWithSocket;
}
```

#### Errors

- [`ProjectNotFoundError`](#projectnotfounderror) to signal that the project
  doesn't exist.
- [`ProjectDataStoreError`](#projectdatastoreerror) to signal problems with
  underlying data store.
- [`ProjectOpenError`](#projectopenerror) to signal failures during server boot.
- [`MissingComponentError`](#missingcomponenterror) to signal that the component
  required to open the project was missing (only in case
  `missingComponentAction` was set to `fail`).
- [`BrokenComponentError`](#brokencomponenterror) to signal that the component
  required to open the project was being installed but is marked as broken (only
  in case `missingComponentAction` was set to `install`).
- [`ComponentInstallationError`](#componentinstallationerror) to signal that the
  installation of a missing component has failed.
- [`ProjectManagerUpgradeRequired`](#projectmanagerupgraderequired) to signal
  that the requested engine version requires a more recent project manager, so
  an upgrade has to be performed before continuing.

### `project/close`

This message requests that the project manager close a specified project. This
operation includes shutting down the language server gracefully so that it can
persist state to disk as needed.

- **Type:** Request
- **Direction:** Client -> Server

## Action Progress Reporting

Some actions, especially those related to installation of new components may
take a long time (for example because big packages need to be downloaded).

The protocol includes notifications tied to such actions that can be used to
display progress bars.

Each task has a lifecycle of being initialized with a `task/started`
notification (which contains a UUID that identifies that task), being updated
with `task/progress-update` and finalized with `task/finished`. `task/finished`
may include an error (but please note that regardless of the task-related error,
the error will also be reported for the original request associated with the
task, for example as `ComponentInstallationError` returned for the
`project/open` request that triggered the installation).

Tasks are sent while an operation is being processed and a single operation may
consist of several (sub)tasks.

For example, when opening a project the flow may be following:

- `project/open` request sent to the server
- notification `task/started` (downloading the archive)
- multiple notifications `task/progress-update` related to that task
- notification `task/finished`
- notification `task/started` (extracting the archive)
- multiple notifications `task/progress-update` related to that task
- notification `task/finished`
- reply to the original `project/open` request

All task progress updates happen within the response/request flow (up to a
possible reordering of messages).

### `task/started`

Indicates that a long running task has been started.

Currently only used when components are being installed to show installation
progress.

- **Type:** Notification
- **Direction:** Server -> Client

   * finished notification.
   */
  taskId: UUID;

  /**
   * Name of the operation this task is related to, for example
   * `project/open`.
   */
  relatedOperation: String;

  /** Unit in which progress of this task is measured. */
  unit: ProgressUnit;

  /**
   * Indicates total expected progress.
   *
   * May be missing, as it is not always known, for example when downloading a
   * file of unknown size or waiting on a lock.
   */
  total?: Long;
}
```

### `task/progress-update`

## Language Server Management

The project manager is also responsible for managing the language server. This
means that it needs to be able to spawn the process, but also tell the process
when to shut down.

A language server process is spawned within the `project/open` call. That call
returns endpoints that the client can use to connect to the language server.
When `project/close` is called, the language server is shutdown. Moreover,
between these two calls, the project manager sends heartbeat messages to the
language server to check if it is still running. In case that it has crashed, a
restart is attempted.

## Errors

The project manager component has its own set of errors. This section is not a
complete specification and will be updated as new errors are added.

Besides the required `code` and `message` fields, the errors may have a `data`
field which can store additional error-specific payload.

### `MissingComponentError`

Signals that a component required to complete the action was missing, but the
action did not ask for it to be automatically installed.

```typescript
"error" : {
  "code" : 4020,
  "message" : "Engine 1.2.3 is required to complete the action but it is not installed."
}
```

### `BrokenComponentError`

Signals that a component that was being installed is marked as broken, but the
option to forcibly install broken components was not set.

This error may handled by warning the user about the broken version or
suggesting to upgrade the project and asking to confirm using the broken
version. If the user wants to ignore the warning, the operation can be
reattempted with the option to forcibly install broken components.

```typescript
"error" : {
  "code" : 4021,
  "message" : "Engine 1.2.3 is marked as broken."
}
```

### `ProjectManagerUpgradeRequired`

Signals that installation of a missing compoment has been attempted, but the
required engine version requires a newer version of project manager than what is
currently running.

This error type includes the optional `data` field which is an object with a
field `minimumRequiredVersion` that is a semver string of the project manager
version that is required to complete the related action.

```typescript
"error" : {
  "code" : 4022,
  "message" : "Project manager 1.2.3 is required to install the requested engine. Please upgrade.",
  "data": {
    "minimumRequiredVersion": "1.2.3"
  }
}
```

### `ComponentInstallationError`

Signals that installation of a missing component has been attempted but it has
failed.

```typescript
"error" : {
  "code" : 4023,
  "message" : "A problem occurred when trying to find the release: Cannot find release `enso-1.2.3-not-published`."
}
```

### `ComponentUninstallationError`

Signals that uninstallation of a component has failed.

```typescript
"error" : {
  "code" : 4024,
  "message" : "The requested engine version is not installed."
}

  "code" : 4025,
  "message" : "Could not connect to github.com"
}
```

### `ProjectNameValidationError`

Signals validation failures.

```typescript
"error" : {
  "code" : 4001,

  "message" : "Cannot close project that is not open"
}
```

### `ProjectOpenByOtherPeersError`

Signals that cannot close a project that is open by other clients.

```typescript
"error" : {
  "code" : 4007,
  "message" : "Cannot close project because it is open by other peers"
}
```

### `CannotRemoveOpenProjectError`

Signals that cannot remove open project.

```typescript
"error" : {
  "code" : 4008,
  "message" : "Cannot remove open project"
}
```
