/* Note [Library Cache Concurrency Model]
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * The library cache may be used by multiple instances of the engine and other
 * tools running concurrently and so it needs to handle concurrent access
 * scenarios.
 *
 * Currently our tools do not provide a way to uninstall libraries from the
 * cache, which will simplify the logic significantly, in the future it may be
 * extended to allow for clearing the cache. (Currently the user can just
 * manually clean the cache directory when no instances are running.)
 *
 * Thanks to the mentioned assumption, once a library is present in the cache,
 * we can assume that it will not disappear, so we do not need to synchronize
 * read access (after checking that the library does indeed exist). What needs
 * to be synchronized is installing libraries - to make sure that if two
 * processes try to install the same library, only one of them actually performs
 * the action. We also need to be sure that when one process checks if the
 * library exists, and if another process is in the middle of installing it, it
 * will not yet report it as existing (as this could lead to loading an
 * only-partially installed library). The primary way of ensuring that will be
 * to install the libraries to a temporary cache directory next to the true
 * cache and atomically move it at the end of the operation. However as we do
 * not have real guarantees that the filesystem move is atomic (although most of
 * the time it should be if it is within a single filesystem), we will use
 * locking to ensure consistency.
 *
 * Obviously, every client that tries to install a library will acquire a write
 * lock for it, so that only one client is actually installing; but also every
 * client checking for the existence of the library will briefly acquire a read
 * lock for that library - thus if the library is currently being installed, the
 * client will need to wait for this read lock until the library installation is
 * finished and so will never encounter it in a 'partially installed' state. If
 * the library is not installed, the client can release the read lock and
 * re-acquire the write lock to try to install it. After acquiring the write
 * lock, it should check again if the library is available, to make sure that no
 * other process installed it in the meantime. This solution is efficient
 * because every library is locked independently and read locks can be acquired
 * by multiple clients at the same time, so the synchronization overhead for
 * already installed libraries is negligible.
 *
 * A single LockManager (and its locks directory) should be associated with at
 * most one library cache directory, as it makes sense for the distribution to
 * have only one cache, so the lock entries are not disambiguated in any way.
 *
 * Additional note: currently, in the cloud, the library cache is stored in the
 * user's workspace, so only a single Language Server will be running at the
 * same time; the locking mechanism is still needed to ensure library
 * installations of the compiler and preinstalls by user's request do not
 * conflict. The same lock manager can be used in the cloud environment, the
 * lock files are stored in a local, transient directory of the server.
 */

/* Note [Temporary Directories for Installation]
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * When installing libraries (however the system is very similar for engines and
 * runtimes too), we extract the files to a temporary directory, to minimize the
 * risk of another process seeing a library in an invalid semi-installed state.
 * To achieve that, we extract the archives into a temporary directory that
 * resides next to the actual libraries directory, to ensure that they are on
 * the same disk partition - this way, after the extraction is complete, the
 * move from the temporary location to the final location is likely to be
 * atomic. (However even if the move is not atomic, everything should be
 * correct, as we also use file locks.)
 *
 * The temporary directory that is next to the destination directory is called
 * local temporary directory.
 *
 * However we also need a place to download the archives too, and as this place
 * does not necessarily need to be on the same partition as the destination, we
 * can use the default system-provided temporary directory. This one is called
 * the global temporary directory. The benefit of using it is that it is usually
 * automatically cleaned by the OS, so we do not need to be as careful about
 * cleanup in failure scenarios as with the local temporary directory.
