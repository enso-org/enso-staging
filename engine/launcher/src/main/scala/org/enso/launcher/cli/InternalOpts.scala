/**
  * Implements internal options that the launcher may use when running another
  * instance of itself.
  *
  * These options are used primarily to implement workarounds for
  * Windows-specific filesystem limitations. They should not be used by the
  * users directly, so they are not displayed in the help text.
  *
  * The implemented features are following:
  *
  * 1. Remove Old Executable
  *    On Windows, if an executable is running, its file is locked, so it is
  *    impossible to remove a file that is running. Thus it is not possible for
  *    the launcher to directly remove its old executable when it finishes the
  *    installation. Instead it launches the newly installed launcher, which
  *    tries to remove it, and terminates itself. Thus the executable lock is
  *    soon freed and the new launcher is able to remove the old one. The new
  *    launcher attempts several retries, because it may take some time for the
  *    executable to be unlocked (especially as on Windows software like an
  *    antivirus may block it for some more time after terminating).
  * 2. Finish Uninstall
  *    After uninstalling the distribution, we need to remove the executable,
  *    but for the same reasons as above, we need a workaround. The uninstaller
  *    creates a copy of itself in a temporary directory (which will be removed
  *    when the system removes temporary files) and uses it to remove the
  *    original binary. It then can also remove the (now empty) installation
  *    directory if necessary.
  * 3. Continue Upgrade
  *    This one is not a Windows-specific workaround but a way for the launcher
  *    to perform multi-step upgrade. If the launcher cannot upgrade directly to
  *    a newer version (because, for example, it requires some additional
  *    upgrade logic), it will first download some version 'in the middle' that
  *    is old enough that it can upgrade to it directly, but new enough that it
  *    has some new upgrade logic. It will extract it and run this temporary
  *    launcher executable, telling it to continue the upgrade. This can be
  *    repeated multiple times if multiple steps are required to reach the
  *    target version. InternalOpts are used to run the new executable with all
  *    the necessary options and to handle the upgrade continuation request.
  * 4. Version and Repository Emulation
  *    To be able to test the upgrade mechanism, we need to run it as built
  *    native executables. But we do not want to do any network requests inside
  *    of the tests because of their instability. Instead, we add internal
  *    options that allow to override the default, network-backed repository
  *    with a fake repository backed by the filesystem. Moreover, to avoid
  *    building multiple fat launcher executables, we provide an internal option
  *    to override its version (and executable location). This option is used by
  *    thin wrappers written in Rust which run the original launcher but
  *    overriding its version. This mechanism is used for testing the multi-step
  *    upgrade. These emulation options are only enabled in development builds.
